Keep Software and Applications Updated: Make sure your operating system, browser, and other software are up to date with the latest security patches and updates to protect against known vulnerabilities.\n\n4. Use a Secure Connection: Before submitting personal or financial information online, make sure the website is secure by looking for the \"https\" and a lock icon in the web address.\n\n5. Be Wary of Phishing Scams: Hackers often use email, text messages or fake websites to trick people into giving away personal or financial information. Be cautious of unsolicited messages or links to suspicious websites.\n\n6. Use Privacy Settings: Social media and other online services have privacy settings that let you control who can see your information. Make use of those settings and limit the amount of personal information you share online.\n\n7. Use Antivirus and Firewall Software: These programs can help protect against malware and other malicious attacks.\n\nIn summary, protecting personal data online requires a combination of strong passwords, secure connections, up-to-date software, safe browsing habits, and being cautious about the information you share online.\n*****QUESTION:***** If there is an explanation: Is the explanation misleading (e.g. arguing for a label that is wrong)?","index":244},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-09-27T13:02:03.181045Z","updated_at":"2023-09-29T09:46:54.869816Z","inner_id":245,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":7,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":53648,"annotations":[{"id":248,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Yes"]},"id":"ErGQKqB5U1","from_name":"sentiment","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-09-29T09:47:09.775346Z","updated_at":"2023-09-29T09:47:09.775369Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":14.775,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"66456af0-4b04-4641-8f56-7fc81b59c328","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":53648,"project":7,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"0216b45e-expl_aio2.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"instruction":"Describe what behavior you think an AI assistant should have when talking to humans?","input":"","output":"An AI assistant should have certain behaviors while interacting with humans, such as:\n\n1. **Politeness**: Use polite words like 'please', 'thank you' and 'excuse me' when interacting with the user.

Ultimately, happiness is a complex and subjective state influenced by numerous factors such as personal circumstances, outlook, relationships and health, and it is not solely determined by one's financial situation.\n*****QUESTION:***** If there is an explanation: Does the explanation list contributing factors?","index":283},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-09-27T13:02:03.183381Z","updated_at":"2023-09-29T09:51:06.773381Z","inner_id":284,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":7,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":53687,"annotations":[{"id":287,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["No"]},"id":"U8RSHTAh8f","from_name":"sentiment","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-09-29T09:51:16.130133Z","updated_at":"2023-09-29T09:51:16.130157Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":9.212,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"5de61105-7666-44a4-ae06-56dac21162a0","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":53687,"project":7,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"0216b45e-expl_aio2.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"instruction":"Assign a truth value (true or false) to the following statement:\n\nMoney cannot buy happiness.","input":"","output":"False. \n\nThe statement \"Money cannot buy happiness\" is a subjective opinion that is often expressed, but it is not an objective or universal truth.

Conserve water: Be mindful of your water usage and try to cut back where possible. Fix leaks, take shorter showers, and use drought-resistant plants in your landscaping.\n\n3. Plant trees and vegetation: Trees and plants not only provide habitat for wildlife, but also help to improve the air quality, and prevent soil erosion.\n\n4. Use public transportation, carpool, or walk\/bike: Reducing the number of cars on the road can significantly decrease greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n5. Practice energy conservation: Making simple changes like turning off lights when you leave a room, using energy-efficient lightbulbs, and unplugging electronics when they’re not in use can help reduce your carbon footprint.\n\n6. Support environmentally-conscious organizations: Consider volunteering with, or financially supporting, organizations working to protect the environment.\n\n7. Be mindful of your purchases: Choose environmentally-friendly products and try to buy from companies with a good track record in terms of sustainability.\n\nOverall, the key is to be aware of the impact your actions have on the environment, and to make conscious choices to reduce any negative effects.\n*****QUESTION:***** If there is an explanation: Is the explanation misleading (e.g. arguing

Substitution: This method involves solving for one variable in one equation, then substituting that solution into the other equation to solve for the remaining variable. After finding the value of one variable, you can substitute it back into one of the equations to obtain the value of the other variable.\n\n3. Elimination: This method involves adding or subtracting the equations to eliminate one of the variables. Once one variable is eliminated, you can solve for the remaining variable. After finding the value of one variable, you can substitute it back into one of the equations to obtain the value of the other variable.\n\n4. Gaussian elimination: This method involves using row operations to transform the augmented matrix of the system into an equivalent matrix in echelon form. Then, back substitution is used to solve for the variables.\n\n5. Matrix methods: Systems of linear equations can also be solved using matrix methods such as the inverse matrix method or Cramer's rule. These methods involve using matrix algebra to represent and solve the system of equations.\n\nRegardless of the method used, the underlying goal is to find the values of the variables that make all the equations in the system true simultaneously.\n*****QUESTION:***** If there is an explanation: Does the explanation include illustrative elements (e.g. examples)?","index":859},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-09-27T13:02:03.247519Z","updated_at":"2023-10-02T08:30:33.084947Z","inner_id":860,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":7,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":54263,"annotations":[{"id":863,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["No"]},"id":"fO3CvM-WB4","from_name":"sentiment","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-10-02T08:30:35.375983Z","updated_at":"2023-10-02T08:30:35.376004Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":2.132,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"5a256a01-a022-494c-8806-0e0a97a6f7f6","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":54263,"project":7,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"0216b45e-expl_aio2.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"instruction":"What are the common techniques for solving a system of linear equations?","input":"","output":"There are several common techniques for solving systems of linear equations, including the following:\n\n1.
